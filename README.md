The SEC-T 0x10sion Music Synthesizer Badge is a kit that attendees of SEC-T 0x10sion 2024 must solder together.
It is an Arduino-compatible music synthesizer kit with:
* a touch keyboard
* built-in speaker/amp
* audio output jack (for high-quality audio)
* 5 programmable RGB LEDs

It is designed to be perfect for total beginners to learn to solder and complete successfully.

The SEC-T Synth Badge comes with a pre-programmed music synthesizer that makes way cool sounds and music and noise.
Once soldering is completed, the SEC-T Synth Badge is a really nice, portable, performing musical instrument!

The SEC-T Synth Badge kit is based on the ArduTouch music synthesizer kit by Mitch Altman / Cornfield Electronics,
which is fully Open Hardware, with a CC BY-SA 4.0 license.

The SEC-T Synth Badge makes use of a modified ArduTouch library, which is available for
programming in more super nice synthesizer features, and for making your own synthesizers.
The library comes with examples (with more to come) that serve as a nice tutorial
on how to create your own SEC-T Synth Badge synthesizers (which are Arduino sketches).

The SEC-T Synth Badge is really just an Arduino Uno clone
with the features listed above, a couple of extra buttons, and a four of pots (for playing music and controlling the sounds).
The ArduTouch Arduino Library is where the real magic comes from!

For those who want to learn more, the documentation teaches the basics of Digital Signal Processing for audio generation.

The SEC-T Synth Badge kit is fully Open Hardware, with a CC BY-SA 4.0 license.

## Demo Videos

The Synth Badge comes pre-programmed with a synth called Quadrant.  
Quadrant is somewhat like a looper.  Every time you play a note it goes into the loop.  You can control the speed of the loop, and you can also make the sound warp (detune) every time through the loop.  
There is the default sound for Quadrant, plus 4 presets -- all 5 of these have very different sounds!  
In addition to changing the loop speed and changing the warp-factor, there are many parameters that you can play with, some of which change the sounds in subtle ways, others which change the sounds a lot.  

These demo videos give you a very small taste of the sounds Quadrant can make. 

___NOTE__:  The demo videos use the prototype of the SEC-T 0x10sion Music Synthesizer Badge kit._  
In particular, the two red buttons are reversed (left and right).
